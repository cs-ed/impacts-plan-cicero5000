# Impacts on Society

This is the *Elementary Statistics and Probability* course at **Alhambra High School**. This course is geared to the students in their senior year of their high school education; it will count as an elective class.However, this course is also geared to students in their junior year at high school; for them, this course will count as their *required third year of mathematics for graduation*. One of the purposes of this course is to teach the students how to use proper compter technology to collect, analyze and interpret data so the can make decisions based on valid data. Production of and access to information has increased dramatically in the past few decades. Such overwhelming amount of information has created the problem of identifying useful, credible and reliable information. The use of computers can assist to solve this problem; *computers can take care of the drudgery of mathematical calculations*, thus **freeing the individual to understand what the results are** and then make the final decision. Students who learn how to use a spreadsheet and statistics-related computer programs will be better prepared to collect, sort and analyze data. Any individual within a family, small business, large corporation/organization, or government who is in a leadership position will be better prepared to make decisions if he/she has **solid computational and statistical skills**.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this course the student should be able to:
1. Collect, sort, organize data from different sources such as the U. S. Census Bureau, other federa/state/local agencies, financial/educational institutions, charities, religious groups into frequency tables using computer technology.
2. Identify socio-political issues that concern them to further analyze them.
3. Analyze data using the five-number summary, binomial and/or normal distributions, linear and non-linear regressions.
4. Predict outcomes based on probability analysis and statistical computer simulations.
5. Evaluate claims and make decisions based on statistical results.

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
