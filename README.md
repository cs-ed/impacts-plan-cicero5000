# Impacts on Society

This is the *Elementary Statistics and Probability* course at **Alhambra High School**. This course is geared to the students in their senior year of their high school education; it will count as an elective class.However, this course is also geared to students in their junior year at high school; for them, this course will count as their *required third year of mathematics for graduation*. One of the purposes of this course is to teach the students how to use proper compter technology to collect, analyze and interpret data so the can make decisions based on valid data. Production of and access to information has increased dramatically in the past few decades. Such overwhelming amount of information has created the problem of identifying useful, credible and reliable information. The use of computers can assist to solve this problem; *computers can take care of the drudgery of mathematical calculations*, thus **freeing the individual to understand what the results are** and then make the final decision. Students who learn how to use a spreadsheet and statistics-related computer programs will be better prepared to collect, sort and analyze data. Any individual within a family, small business, large corporation/organization, or government who is in a leadership position will be better prepared to make decisions if he/she has **solid computational and statistical skills**.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this course the student should be able to:
1. Collect, sort, organize data from different sources such as the U. S. Census Bureau, other federa/state/local agencies, financial/educational institutions, charities, religious groups into frequency tables using computer technology.
2. Identify socio-political issues that concern them to further analyze them.
3. Analyze data using the five-number summary, binomial and/or normal distributions, linear and non-linear regressions.
4. Predict outcomes based on probability analysis and statistical computer simulations.
5. Evaluate claims and make decisions based on statistical results.

### Learning Activities

1. Students will start a discussion in groups of 3 or 4 students about a topic that is relevant to them. At the end of the discussion, each student will write a short summary that includes their reasons for choosing such topic and how it is relevant to their lives. The discusion will continue as a whole class so other students know about the different topics of interest.
2. Students will collect data about their chosen topic from reputable websites, publications and, if possible, interviews.
3. Students will share the data they collected and help each other to organize their data on frequency tables and different charts/graphs.
4. Students will help each other to perform regression analysis of the data they collected and make predictions based on the equations of their regression analysis.
5. Students will use the proper computer software/website to perform computer simulations to re-evaluate their results and accept or reject claims about the topic they selected to analyze.
6. Students will give an oral presentation insmall group to the est of the class explaining their data collection, organization, analysis and decision-making process.
   
**These activities will be performed one or two times per month depending on the complexities of the topics being discussed**

### Assessment

1. Weekly quizzes and chapter tests will be adminstered to the students to determine if they understand basic concepts, definitions and calculations related to the subject explained in class.
2. Research projects will be used to evaluate the students' applications of the topics explained in class to real life situations.
3. Oral presentations will be used to evaluate the students' understanding and reasoning of their final decision at the end of their research project.

**The students' understanding will be determined according to the accuracy of their answers and calculations as well as their reasoning based on statistical concepts and interpretation of computer simulations.**

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
